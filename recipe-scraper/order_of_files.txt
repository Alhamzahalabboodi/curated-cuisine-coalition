main.ipynb was ran to scrape recipe information based off of URLs from SeriousEatsCSV.csv.

This produced: recipes.csv and recipes.json.

Due to error in image scraping, imagegrabber.ipynb was used on recipes(wrongimageurls).csv

This produced: filtered_recipes.csv

Because we wanted to reformat our data set, we made formatter.ipynb to do so.

This produced: final_recipes.csv and rewrote recipes.json
